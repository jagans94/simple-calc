# simple-calc
A simple calculator written in swift 3.0


This calculator is my first app .
It is just a simple calculator so not all exhaustive functionalities have been covered and no animations either.
I modeled its functionalities based on my phones calculator.
Some redundancies might have been overlooked. 
Further things that can be done: 
 1. limit input values to 10 digits- but why, the double will take care of any input that may exceed int limits
 2. auto-adjusting dynamic display to accomodate all digits pressed. - partial solution implemented
 3. a delete button which dynamically affects display and calculated value

If you know of a better way to implement this program, please let me know. I'm always looking forward to improving my coding skills.:)
