# simple-calc
A simple calculator written in swift 3.0

Read Me
This calculator is my first app .
This is just a simple calculator. Not all exhaustive functionalities have been covered. No animations either.
I modeled its functionalities based on my phones calculator
Some redundancies might have been overlooked 
// Further things that can be done: 
//  1. limit input values to 10 digits- but why, the double will take care of any input that may exceed int limits
//  2. auto-adjusting dynamic display to accomodate all digits pressed. - partial solution implemented
//  3. a delete button which dynamically affects display and calculated value

If you know of a better way to implement this program, please let me know. I'm always looking forward to improving my coding skills.:)
